This is a screenshot from the game EA FC 24. I need to know key details about the screenshot, you will provide an answer using a specific json template.
First, you will tell me if the user is playing a match or if the user is navigating a menu. 
If in a match, is the screenshot from an instant replay within a match or the live action on the field??
Then you will tell me if there is a minimap at the bottom of the screen or not?

Answer only by using the following template.
{
    "match-status" : "IN-MATCH" | "IN-MENU",
    "in-match-status": "NONE" | "INSTANT-REPLAY" | "LIVE-MATCH",
    "minimap" : "YES" | "NO"
}
